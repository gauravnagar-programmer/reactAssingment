React Product App

This is a simple React web app built to practice core frontend concepts.
The app works with product data and basic UI features.

Features
1. Product List View

Product data comes from a JSON list

Data is shown on the screen

Two view modes are available:

Table View

Card View

A button is used to switch between views

2. Search with Debounce

You can search products by name

Search is debounced by 500 milliseconds

This avoids unnecessary re-renders

Search works on the product list only

3. Pagination

Products are split into pages

Each page shows a fixed number of items

Page buttons are generated dynamically

Pagination updates correctly after search

4. Routing

React Router is used

Pages are separated using routes

Navigation works without page reload

5. Product Form

A separate form is included

Used to create product details

Includes basic validation

This form is not connected to the product list

It exists as an independent feature
